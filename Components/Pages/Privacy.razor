        Privacy &amp; Data Handling
    </h1>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Your privacy and the security of your financial data are fundamental to how
        Accounting for Dentists is designed and operated. This page explains what
        data is stored, how it is handled, and the steps taken to protect it.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        Data We Store
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-3 text-base">
        Accounting for Dentists stores only the data required to provide its
        functionality, including:
    </p>

    <ul class="mb-6 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
        <li>Income and expense records entered by you</li>
        <li>Categories, dates, and amounts associated with those records</li>
        <li>Uploaded attachments such as receipts and invoices</li>
        <li>Basic authentication identifiers required to associate data with your account</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed">
        The application does <span class="font-medium">not</span> collect advertising
        data, analytics profiles, or unrelated personal information.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        How Your Data Is Stored
    </h2>

    <ul class="mb-6 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
        <li>Each user’s data is stored in a dedicated, isolated data store</li>
        <li>Financial data is encrypted at rest</li>
        <li>Data is never shared between users or tenants</li>
        <li>Access is restricted to authenticated users only</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed">
        This architecture ensures strong separation between users and reduces the
        risk of accidental or unauthorised access.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        Authentication &amp; Access
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Authentication is handled using secure, industry-standard sign-in
        mechanisms. The application relies on trusted identity providers to verify
        your identity and does not store passwords directly.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        Data Usage
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Your data is used solely to provide the features of the application,
        including record keeping, reporting, and document storage. It is not sold,
        rented, or shared with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        Data Retention
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Your data remains stored for as long as your account exists. You retain full
        control over your records and may delete entries or attachments at any time.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        Your Responsibility
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-6 text-base leading-relaxed">
        While strong technical safeguards are in place, you are responsible for
        maintaining the security of your account credentials and ensuring that
        access to your device and sign-in methods is appropriately protected.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
