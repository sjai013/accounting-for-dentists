        About Accounting for Dentists (@("v" + version))
    </h1>

    <p class="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed">
        <strong>Accounting for Dentists</strong> is a simple, secure accounting
        application designed to help dentists and other solo practitioners manage
        their financial records with confidence.
    </p>

    <p class="mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Running a practice means balancing clinical work, administration, and
        compliance. This application exists to reduce the burden of bookkeeping by
        providing a clear and structured way to record income, track expenses, and
        prepare information needed for tax and reporting obligations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        What the Application Does
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-3 text-base">Accounting for Dentists helps you:</p>

    <ul class="mb-6 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
        <li>Record income and expenses in one place</li>
        <li>Attach receipts and supporting documents</li>
        <li>Keep financial data organised throughout the year</li>
        <li>Prepare summaries to support BAS and tax reporting</li>
        <li>Maintain a clear view of your practice’s financial position</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed">
        The focus is on <span class="font-medium">practical bookkeeping</span>, not
        replacing your accountant — making it easier to provide clean,
        well-organised data when it matters.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        Designed With Security in Mind
    </h2>

    <p class="mb-3 text-base">Your data is private and isolated:</p>

    <ul class="mb-6 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
        <li>Each user has their own dedicated data store</li>
        <li>Financial data is encrypted at rest</li>
        <li>Authentication uses secure, industry-standard sign-in technology</li>
        <li>No tenant can access another tenant’s data</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed">
        This design ensures strong separation between users while keeping the system
        simple and reliable.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        Who This Is For
    </h2>

    <ul class="mb-6 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
        <li>Dentists and dental specialists</li>
        <li>Sole traders and independent professionals</li>
        <li>Small practices seeking a lightweight accounting solution</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed">
        If you need straightforward financial tracking without the complexity of
        enterprise accounting software, this application is designed for you.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        What This Application Is Not
    </h2>

    <ul class="mb-6 list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
        <li>It does not provide financial or tax advice</li>
        <li>It does not replace a qualified accountant or tax professional</li>
        <li>It does not submit tax returns on your behalf</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-8 text-base leading-relaxed">
        Instead, it helps you stay organised so those processes are faster, clearer,
        and less stressful.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mb-3 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-900">
        Built for Real-World Use
    </h2>

    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
        Accounting for Dentists was created to support real accounting workflows,
        with an emphasis on simplicity, clear data ownership, long-term
        maintainability, and user control over financial information.
